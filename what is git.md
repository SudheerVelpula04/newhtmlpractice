4. git commit -m "commit message": Records the changes in the staging area to the Git history with a commit message explaining the changes.
5. git status: Shows the current status of the repository, including which files have changes and which files are staged for the next commit.
6. git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
7. git pull: Downloads changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the local branch.
8. git branch: Lists all branches in the repository. An asterisk (*) denotes the currently active branch.
9. git checkout <branch_name>: Switches to the specified branch.
10. git merge <branch_name>: Merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It provides a platform that allows developers and teams to collaborate on software development projects, track changes, manage code repositories, and work together to improve code quality. 
# Repositories: 
GitHub hosts Git repositories, which are used to store and manage code for projects. Each project typically has its own repository where developers can push and pull changes.
# Collaboration: 
GitHub allows multiple developers to work together on the same project. They can collaborate, contribute, and review each other's code using pull requests, issues, and discussions.
# Pull Requests: 
Developers can submit changes to a repository in the form of a pull request. This is a request to merge their changes into the main branch. Other developers can review the code, discuss the changes, and provide feedback before merging.
# Issues and Discussions:
GitHub provides a way to track and manage issues or bug reports for projects. Developers and users can create issues, comment on them, and work together to resolve problems or suggest improvements.
# Wikis and Documentation: 
Repositories can have wikis to host project documentation, guides, and other useful information.
# GitHub Actions:
    GitHub Actions is an integrated continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service that allows developers to automate various workflows, such as running tests, building and deploying applications, and more.
# Security Features:
GitHub has built-in security features to help identify vulnerabilities in code and dependencies, and it supports code scanning and alerts.
# Community and Open Source: 
GitHub hosts a massive community of developers, making it a central hub for open-source projects. Many popular open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, encouraging contributions from developers worldwide.
